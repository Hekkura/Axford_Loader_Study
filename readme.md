# Neb Wallpaper Parallax

A simple HTML image viewer with a JS function that incorporates GSAP for a mouse move parallax effect. 

This app allows you to add new images by simply adding a new folder in the Assets folder containing the necessary images for the parallax images

In order for the parallax image to work, you need the base background that has been filled in and the foreground images that has been isolated **but remains the same size with the same position as the primary image**

Use foreground removers and AI background fillers to fill background layers and use image editors to isolate foreground layers.

After that, insert the name of the folder inside the Assets folder to the folders variable in the script.js file, as well as the name of the folder as a key and an array of strings of the image names as the value.
